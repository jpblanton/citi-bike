	The query should be formatted as Table data and have a geohash column and a numeric metric column.

    Location Name Field (optional): enter the name of the Location Name column. Used to label each circle on the map. If it is empty then the geohash value is used as the label.
    Geohash Field: enter the name of the geohash column. This is used to calculate where the circle should be drawn.
    Metric Field: enter the name of the metric column. This is used to give the circle a value - this determines how large the circle is.


looks like we'll need a view that is the latest available data
will contain: name, geohash (confirm what that is), capacity data

this should be the view:
create view test as select A.station_name, (C.bikes + C.ebikes) / cast(A.station_cap as numeric) as metric, A.station_cap, C.bikes, C.ebikes,  B.longitude, B.latitude from names A, location B, (select station_id, last(bikes_available, time) as bikes, last(ebikes_available, time) as ebikes from status group by station_id) C where A.station_id = B.station_id and A.station_id = C.station_id;

lat/lon is in location, cap is in names (as is name)
need (station_name, metric (avail/cap), lon, lat)

quick script & another timescaledb to monitor capacity values & changes over time
